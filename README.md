  <h2>What's a Hackathon?</h2>
  <p>
    A Hackathon is a collaboration of programmers and designers to code, design and build innovative solutions to real life problems, through extensive coding in a short time duration. Hackathons are great way to promote innovation among students by bringing in cutting-edge problem statements. See this for a good explanation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your only constraint is: You only have 30 hours.

  <h2>NIT Surat's foremost Hackathon.</h2>
  <p>
    Hackathons provide a venue for self-expression and creativity through technology. People with technical backgrounds come together, form teams around a problem or idea, and collaboratively code a unique solution from scratch - these generally take shape in the form of websites, mobile apps, and robots. So prepare yourself for a weekend filled with learning new technologies, building amazing products and making new friends all within the span of 30 hours.

  <h2>Everyone is welcome.</h2>
  <p>
    Whether you're making your first website, hacking Oculus Rift to censor real world ads, or creating something fun; InOut is for you. We'll have great workshops, mentors, and more!
    <br/>
    We will allow you to show your coding skills without getting worried about any mortal needs. We will take care of everything.
